    "Create Table" to go live.

## Step 2: Bring Your Friends

1.  **Share Your Table Link:** After creating a table, a unique link
    will be generated. Share this link with your friends via messaging
    apps, social media, or email.

2.  **Encourage Participation:** Let your friends know they can join a
    fair, secure, and transparent poker table powered by blockchain
    technology.

## Step 3: Share the Revenue

1.  **How Rake Works:**

    -   A small percentage (5%) of each pot is collected as rake.

    -   For example, if the average pot size is \$10, the rake is \$0.50
        per hand.

2.  **Revenue Sharing:**

    -   Pure Poker shares the collected rake revenue 50/50 with the table
        host.

    -   The more active your table, the more you can earn!

## Potential Earnings for Table Hosts

Here's an example to demonstrate how much you can earn as a poker host:

-   **You have 8 players.**

-   **Average pot:** \$10.

-   **Average game time:** 5 minutes.

-   **Rake:** 5%.

This means:

-   **The rake per hand is \$0.50.**

-   If one hand is played every 5 minutes, the table generates \$6 in
    rake per hour (12 hands/hour).

-   **Revenue is shared 50/50:** The host earns \$3 per hour per table.

**Additional notes:**

-   No commission cap.

-   No cap on tables.

## Maximize Your Earning Potential

-   **Unlimited Earnings:** There is no limit to the amount of rake you
    can earn. The more games played at your table, the higher your
    revenue.

-   **Host Multiple Tables:** You can host as many tables as you want,
    allowing you to scale your earning potential.

    your public tables, creating a vibrant and active poker community
