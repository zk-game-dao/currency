# What’s in the cards?

Our roadmap lays out the milestones and features we’re working on to keep improving your poker experience. From upcoming updates to long-term goals, you’ll see exactly where we’re headed and how we plan to get there.

## End of Q2 2025

### Tournaments
The primary feature set will include structured tournament functionality to engage players competitively:

Variety of Tournament Types: Including popular formats like Sit & Go, Knockout, and Multi-table Tournaments (MTTs).
Prize Pools and Leaderboards: Buy-in options, automated prize distribution, and leaderboards to create competitive dynamics.
Objective: To drive engagement, build community interest, and establish a competitive, rewarding environment as a foundation for Clans and future tokenized gameplay.

## End of Q3 2025

### Clans
The Clans system is designed to enable influencers and community leaders to bring their communities to the platform in dedicated, semi-autonomous spaces:

Dedicated Clan Areas: Private sections within the Dapp for clan members, fostering exclusive, community-driven engagement.
Revenue Sharing Model: Clan leaders or influencers earn a portion of the revenue from their community’s gameplay, incentivizing leaders to bring and retain their members.
Clan Tournaments and Leaderboards: Custom events within each clan to foster competition and community building.
Objective: To leverage community-based marketing, increase player retention through social structures, and reward influencers for community engagement.

## Sometime in 2025

### Token Generation Event
The Dapp will initiate a Token Generation Event (TGE) on [odin.fun](https://odin.fun/)

### Fully On-Chain Zero-Knowledge Proof Implementation for Fairness
The Dapp will implement fully on-chain Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to guarantee fairness in the game mechanics, specifically in the shuffle and deal processes:

On-Chain Fairness Verification: By using ZKPs on-chain, the platform will enable players to verify that each shuffle is fair, without disclosing sensitive game data. This ensures that players can independently confirm the integrity of the game.
Enhanced Security and Transparency: On-chain ZKPs provide a secure and transparent environment, where fairness and gameplay integrity are guaranteed without needing external validation.
Trust as a Competitive Differentiator: With provable on-chain fairness, the Dapp positions itself as a secure, transparent, and player-centric platform.
